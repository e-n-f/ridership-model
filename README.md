ridership-model
---------------

For the record, these are my predictions for the daily ridership
of stations on the Silicon Valley BART extension, if the
7 stations currently planned or under construction are built.

Station | Predicted daily exits
------- | ---------------------
Warm Springs | 3931
Milpitas | 3836
Berryessa | 4054
Alum Rock | 3841
San Jose | 7081
Diridon | 4682
Santa Clara | 4063

The model predicts ridership of existing stations with a geometric standard deviation of 1.53,
meaning we can be 95% confident that the ridership will not be lower than
43% of this prediction or greater than 233% of it.

I consider it fairly unlikely (1.7 standard deviations out) that the
three stations of the Berryessa Extension will have 23,000 riders per day
at opening [as predicted](http://www.vta.org/bart/faq).
I predict 3557 when Warm Springs alone opens, and 11,936 for the three stations together.
Maybe by 23,000 they mean both entries and exits, which wouldn't be far off.

The 55,000 [projected daily riders](http://vtaorgcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Site_Content/BARTPhase2-ScopingPresentation-50212.pdf)
of the remaning 4 stations is slightly more unlikely, 2.4 standard deviations away.
Again, maybe they really mean both entries and exits.

If Livermore and eBART riders behave like other BART riders, I also predict the following:

Station | Predicted daily exits
------- | ---------------------
Railroad Ave | 5082
Antioch | 5307
Isabel Ave | 2760
