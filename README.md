ridership-model
---------------

For the record, these are my predictions for the daily ridership
of stations on the Silicon Valley BART extension, if the
7 stations currently planned or under construction are built.

Station | Predicted ridership
------- | -------------------
Warm Springs | 274
Milpitas | 335
Berryessa | 698
Alum Rock | 698
San Jose | 2643
Diridon | 1240
Santa Clara | 362

The model predicts ridership of existing stations with a geometric standard deviation of 1.72,
meaning we can be 95% confident that the ridership will not be lower than
34% of this prediction or greater than 295% of it.

I consider it extremely unlikely (5.3 standard deviations out) that the
three stations of the Berryessa Extension will have 23,000 riders per day
at opening [as predicted](http://www.vta.org/bart/faq).

The 55,000 [projected daily riders](http://vtaorgcontent.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Site_Content/BARTPhase2-ScopingPresentation-50212.pdf)
of the remaning 4 stations are only slightly less unlikely, 4.5 standard deviations away.
